Thank you for downloading the Wrath of Ashardalon Tile System plugin.
These files, combined with the TileSystem application, will allow 
you to create custom maps using the Wrath of Ashardalon tiles and pieces.

Due to the size of the images, the plugin is broken apart into eight
different ZIP files:

 - Ashardalon_Basic.zip
 - Ashardalon_Figures.zip
 - Ashardalon_NamedTiles.zip
 - Ashardalon_DireChamberTiles.zip
 - Ashardalon_HorridChamberTiles.zip
 - Ashardalon_NormalTilesWhite.zip
 - Ashardalon_NormalTilesBlack.zip
 - Ashardalon_Tokens.zip

You can download all of these at the BoardGameGeek Wrath of Ashardalon
file pages, here:

To properly install and use this plugin, do the following:

1. Download and 'install' TileSystem
This plugin is to be used with TileSystem. You can download the TileSystem at:

	http://members.cox.net/shawnriordan/tilesystem.htm

There is no 'installation' of the TileSystem, merely extract the files
in the downloaded ZIP file to any convenient location. Note that TileSystem
was originally created for DOOM: The Boardgame and so has many images for
that game. However, since it is very open ended, this Castle Ravenloft 
plugin will sit side-by-side with Doom (or Descent or Space Hulk or 
whatever other TileSystem plugins you have installed).

2. Download all the ZIP files.
Go to Boardgame geek and download all the files listed above.

3. Extract Ashardalon_Basic.zip into the TileSystem folder.
The first file to extract is the 'Basic' file. Extract this zip file
into the same folder you extracted the TileSystem into. This will the 
following:
 - Ashardalon (folder)
 - AshardalonSample.ts
 - AshardalonLordsOfDeath.ts
 - AshardalonPartInstructions.txt
 - AshardalonRavenloft.set

4. Extract the other ZIPs into the 'Ashardalon' folder
The other 'Ashardalon_' zip files need to be extracted into the 
Ashardalon folder that was extracted from the Basic zip file.
It is important that all the images from these ZIP files are in the
same location, and not in sub folders. 

5. Launch TileSystem.exe
Find the file TileSystem.exe that you extracted in step 1 and 
launch the application (i.e. dbl-click).

6. Change Tilesets or open AshardalonSample.ts
With the TileSystem application launched, it will by default display the
Doom tiles. To switch to the Wrath of Ashardalon tiles, you can either 
click on File | Change Tileset or you can simply open one of the
included AshardalonSample.ts files.
