## Conclusion

The encounter card system is **50% complete** with a solid foundation:
- ✅ All 53 cards are in the game and can be drawn
- ✅ 26 cards (49%) are fully functional
- ✅ 4 cards (8%) are partially implemented
- 📋 23 cards (43%) display but don't execute effects

The core systems work well: deck management, drawing, discarding, damage, attacks, curses, and basic environments. The remaining work requires implementing trap/hazard systems and complex special event logic.

**For gameplay**: Players can experience the majority of encounter card mechanics. The missing implementations are primarily complex special cases that can be manually resolved by players following the card text.
